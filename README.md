Introduction
This project is a demonstration of how to build a REST API using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, JPA, and Hibernate. It covers setting up the project, creating RESTful endpoints, and integrating with a PostgreSQL database using JPA and Hibernate for ORM.

Features
Spring Boot application setup
RESTful API development
PostgreSQL database integration
JPA and Hibernate for ORM
CRUD operations
Unit and integration testing
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
Maven 3.6.0 or later
PostgreSQL database
An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
Git
Installation

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/postgresql-jpa-hibernate-rest-api-demo-master.git
Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd postgresql-jpa-hibernate-rest-api-demo-master
Configure PostgreSQL database:
Update src/main/resources/application.properties with your PostgreSQL configuration:
properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdatabase
spring.datasource.username=yourusername
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
